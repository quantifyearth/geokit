geokit
------

*Status: V. WIP and Experimental*

Geokit is a tool for version controlling large geospatial datasets. Data is
stored using ZFS with automatic metadata extraction of common geospatial
formats.

`Geokit_server` will provide a relatively simple REST API for spatially querying
a geokit repository and obtaining the raw data.
